        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Bachelors in Computer Science - Software, Systems and Networks</h3>
        <h4>Statistics Minor</h4>
        <h5>Charlotte, NC</h5>
        <p>
          I was born in Cuba but grew up in Florida, and have recently relocated
          to pursue a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics at
          UNC-Charlotte. Growing up I had a natural attraction to cars and
          motorsports which has led me to become a very technical individual. I
          was always interested in working with computers which led me to take
          several Web Design courses in high-school. However, after graduating
          high-school I did not attend college right away. Instead, I went onto
          the workforce and as a technical individual I pursued a career as a
          manufacturing technician. After several years in the workforce, I
          decided that it was time to pursue higher education. Given my
          background with Web development, I knew that pursuing a Bachelors of
          Science in Computer Science would be the correct path for me.
