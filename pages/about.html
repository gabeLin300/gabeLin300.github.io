    <h2>Bacherlors in Computer Science - Software, Systems and Networks</h2>
    <h3>Statistics Minor</h3>
    <h4>Charlotte, NC</h4>
    <p>
      I was born in Cuba but grew up in Florida, and have recently relocated to
      pursue a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics at
      UNC-Charlotte. Growing up I had a natural attraction to cars and
      motorsports which has led me to become a very technical individual. I was
      always interested in working with computers which led me to take several
      Web Design courses in high-school. However, after graduating high-school I
      did not attend college right away. Instead, I went onto the workforce and
      as a technical individual I pursued a career as a manufacturing
      technician. After several years in the workforce, I decided that it was
      time to pursue higher education. Given my background with Web development,
      I knew that pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science would be
      the correct path for me.
